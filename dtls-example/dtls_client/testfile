I'm not good at C and I'm trying to do something simple. I want to open a binary file, read blocks of 1024 bytes of data and dump into a buffer, process the buffer, read another 1024 byes of data and keep doing this until EOF. I know how / what I want to do with the buffer, but it's the loop part and file I/O I keep getting stuck on.
